</p>

<p>I'm currently pursuing my degree in Artificial Intelligence from Centennial College. My love for AI started when I wanted to make a personal assistant app of my own capable of almost all automation capabilities in a house combined with a chatbot. I'm continually fascinated by the power of AI and how it is changing the world around us.</p>

<p>Apart from AI, I'm also interested in various other areas of computer science, such as web development, software development, and gaming. I believe that a strong foundation in these areas can complement my AI skills and make me a well-rounded professional.</p>
